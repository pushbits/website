PushBits is a relay server for push notifications.
It enables you to send notifications via a simple web API, and delivers them to you through [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).
This is similar to what [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) and [Gotify](https://gotify.net/) offer, but it does not require an additional app.
